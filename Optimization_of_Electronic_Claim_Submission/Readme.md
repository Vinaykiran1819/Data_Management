### Overview
The project aimed at optimizing electronic claim submissions involved the creation of an automated business model designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of healthcare claim processing, benefiting patients, providers, and insurance companies. We developed and implemented a robust RDS database using DBeaver, crafted an Entity-Relationship Model, and executed data integration along with comprehensive performance evaluations to ensure optimal operation. Through strategic data optimization and performance tuning, we imported a significant amount of data and successfully halved the database query processing times, streamlining the claims process and markedly improving its efficiency. This initiative not only reduced the administrative burden but also improved financial transparency and patient care through more efficient and accurate claim processing.
